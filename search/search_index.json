We are currently analyzing MERS data below. MERS Lipidomics Data There are many datasets from the following publications MPLEx: a Robust and Universal Protocol for Single-Sample Integrative Proteomic, Metabolomic, and Lipidomic Analyses The raw lipidomics data as a start can be found in MassIVE: Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus MHAE003 - MSV000083535 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083534 Primary human airway epithelial cells lipidome response to an icMERS coronavirus - MSV000083533 These data from Thomas O. Metz's Lab from PNNL are time course studies of the lipidome of the airway epitheleal tissue. We have compiled the metadata from the data (here)[data/MSV000083535_metadata_combined.tsv].
